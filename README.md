# Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis
This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This program, offered by Coursera, serves as preparation for aspiring data analysts to start their career by learning key data analysis skills such as preparing, cleaning, and analyzing data; creating visualizations; and using tools such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, and R.

## The Scenario
We are a junior data analyst working for a bike-sharing company called Cyclistic. The goal here is to maximize the number of riders who have annual memberships. To do this, we need to analyze and learn how casual riders and members use the Cyclistic bikes differently. From there, we can recommend a marketing strategy. To learn more about our scenario and the steps we'll take to achieve this goal, refer to the [Case Study Instructions](https://github.com/AaronChao4/Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis/blob/main/Case%20Study%20Instructions%20(Provided%20by%20Coursera).pdf) file.

## The Dataset
The dataset we are given to work with can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and it includes the following columns:

| Column  | Column Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ride_id  | A unique ID number given for a ride |
| rideable_type  | Type of bicycle used |
| started_at | Date and time the ride started |
| ended_at | Date and time the ride ended |
| start_station_name | The station the ride started at |
| end_station_name | The station the ride ended at |
| start_lat | Starting latitude of the start station |
| start_lng | Starting longitude of the start station |
| end_lat | Ending latitude of the end station |
| end_lng | Ending longitude of the end station |
| member_casual | Membership type of the rider |

For this study, I used data spanning from December 2021 to November 2022.

## Report and Analysis
For this project, I used a combination of Python with Jupyter Notebook, SQL, and PowerBI. My report — which contains a detailed description of what this case study entails, the steps I've taken to clean and transform the data, my analysis, my final recommendations, and my Python codes — can be found in this [Jupyter Notebook](). To gain further insight of the data, I conducted descriptive analysis using SQL, and my SQL code can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronChao4/Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis/blob/main/SQL_Code_Bikeshare.sql), while the SQL code outputs can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronChao4/Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis/blob/main/SQL_Code_Output.pdf). To visualize the data, I used Microsoft PowerBI and exported my visualizations to this [PDF](https://github.com/AaronChao4/Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis/blob/main/Visualization.pdf).
